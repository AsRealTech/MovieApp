/*
comprehensive review of your Movie Recommendation App project:

Architecture & Integration
Fullstack Integration:
Your React frontend is well-connected to the Express backend, with clear API endpoints for authentication, movie data, watchlists, favorites, reviews, and profile management.
External API:
TMDB is integrated for movie discovery and details.
Core Features
Authentication:
Registration and login use JWT for secure sessions. Passwords are hashed in the database.
Movie Discovery:
Users can search, filter, and view detailed movie info from TMDB.
Favorites & Watchlist:
Users can add movies to favorites and watchlists, with full details displayed in the UI.
Reviews:
Users can submit and view reviews for each movie, with ratings and comments.
User Profile:
Users can view and edit their profile, including username, email, and password.
Error Handling & Loading States:
All major components handle loading and error states for a smooth UX.
Technical Implementation

Express.js RESTful API
MongoDB models for User, Movie, Watchlist, Review
Endpoints for all major features
JWT middleware for protected routes
CORS and JSON parsing enabled
Frontend:
React with modern UI and routing
State management for user session, loading, errors

Deployment Readiness

Frontend:

Code Quality & Best Practices
Separation of Concerns:
Clear separation between frontend and backend logic.
Security:
Passwords are hashed, JWT is used for authentication, and user data is protected.
Scalability:
Models and endpoints are designed for easy extension (e.g., social features, recommendations).
Areas for Further Improvement

Reviews:
Consider adding review editing/deletion and average ratings.
Favorites/Watchlist:
Add ability to remove movies from lists.

Profile:
Add avatar upload or more profile fields.
Testing:
